# Binary-Gray Code Converter
## Overview
The Binary-Gray Code Converter is a simple project with the aim of converting binary
code to gray code, and vice versa.

Binary Code is a way of representing data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system 
used contains '1' and '0'. Gray code, on the other hand, is an encoding of numbers such that
adjacent numbers have a single bit difference of 1. Gray code can also be used to refer to
Reflected Binary Code (RBC).

This project was developed in Pycharm, but it is totally ok to use any code editor of your
choice.
